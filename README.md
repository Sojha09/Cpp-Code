C++ Code Solutions
Welcome to my repository of C++ solutions! In this repository, I have included various algorithmic problems and their solutions written in C++. These solutions demonstrate my understanding of key computer science concepts, algorithms, and data structures.

About the Repository
This repository contains solutions to several C++ problems ranging from basic programming challenges to more complex algorithmic problems. The goal of this repository is to:

Showcase my problem-solving skills.
Demonstrate my understanding of C++ programming.
Provide solutions to common coding challenges using efficient algorithms and techniques.
Each problem in this repository includes:

A problem statement explaining the challenge.
A description of the approach used to solve the problem.
A clean, optimized C++ solution for the problem.
Problem Statements
The problems in this repository cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

Sorting and Searching
Recursion and Backtracking
Mathematical Computations
Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.)
Each problem will have a clear description of the requirements and constraints, followed by a C++ solution that aims to be both efficient and easy to understand.

How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-code-solutions.git
Navigate to the folder containing the problem solution you want to run:

bash
Copy code
cd cpp-code-solutions
Compile the C++ code:

bash
Copy code
g++ problem1.cpp -o problem1
Run the compiled program:

bash
Copy code
./problem1
